        <h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">Well, I must say!</p>

        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>  
        <p class="direction">(still writing)</p> 
        <p class="speech">Have you read it through?</p>

        <h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6> 
        <p class="direction">(laying the MS. on the desk)</p> 
        <p class="speech">Yes, indeed I have.</p>

        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
        <p class="speech"> Don't you think the Doctor hits them pretty hard?</p>

        <h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6>
        <p class="speech"> Hard? Bless my soul, he's crushing! Every word falls like—how
        shall I put it?—like the blow of a sledgehammer.</p>

        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">Yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the
        first blow.</p>

        <h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">That is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon
        blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. As I sat in
        there reading this, I almost seemed to see a revolution in being.</p>

        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6> 
        <p class="direction">(turning round)</p> 
        <p class="speech">Hush!—Speak so that Aslaksen cannot hear you.</p>

        <h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6> 
        <p class="direction">(lowering his voice)</p>
        <p class="speech"> Aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a
        coward; there is nothing of the man in him. But this time you will
        insist on your own way, won't you? You will put the Doctor's article in?</p>

        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">Yes, and if the Mayor doesn't like it—</p>

        <h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">That will be the devil of a nuisance.</p>

        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">Well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account,
        whatever happens. If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctor's
        project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him—the whole of
        the Householders' Association and the rest of them. And if he does fall
        in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
        in the Baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters—</p>

        <h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
        penny—</p>

        <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
        be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
        enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
        another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
        the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
        the Liberals.</p>

        <h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">That is perfectly true! I see it coming—I see it coming; we
        are on the threshold of a revolution!</p>
