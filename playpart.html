        <p>Mrs. Stockmann. But, Thomas, don't you see—?<br>

            Dr. Stockmann (turning in the doorway). Oh, is it you, Peter? (Shakes
            hands with him.) Now that is very delightful.<br>
            
            Peter Stockmann. Unfortunately I must go in a moment—<br>
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Rubbish! There is some toddy just coming in. You haven't
            forgotten the toddy, Katherine?<br>
            
            Mrs. Stockmann. Of course not; the water is boiling now. (Goes into the
            dining-room.)<br>
            
            Peter Stockmann. Toddy too!<br>
            
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, sit down and we will have it comfortably.<br>
            
            Peter Stockmann. Thanks, I never care about an evening's drinking.<br>
            
            Dr. Stockmann. But this isn't an evening's drinking.
